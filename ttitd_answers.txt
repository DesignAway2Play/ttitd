Tell me a little about yourself and your background.

Sylvester- Uber driver and a photographer with prior exposure to weed
Virgie - I love tiny cats, chihuahuas and neon nail polish as well as Dolly Parton. I'm also a Taurus.

If you wish to share, what drugs do you enjoy

Sylvester-consumed weed as an edible, frog skin, Aiwaska and opiods
Virgie - marijuana (dosist pen, primarily)

Before trying out an unfamiliar drug, do you do research prior? If so, tell me a little
about your research process

Sylvester-usually get first hand information from friends who have experimented with it and are in the vicinity of the product to get you familiar with
Virgie - yes, I'm only interested in regulated, properly dosed drugs because I don't like feeling like I don't have control over the process. I typically ask friends about their experiences and how the drug affects them

When explaining a drug to a newbie and its effects, what key information would you include?

Sylvester- the expeience of how it makes you feel and how long it lasts for and what is the after effects for them to be aware of.
Virgie - duration of high, dosage, whether it's an upper or downer, when to take it (time of day if it's a long high or weekend if there are side effects), their mental health (if they have depression or other mentell illness I would want to know and talk to them about potential side effects and make sure they have a plan if the drug is likelier to lead to spikes in mood), also I'd tell them if I had a bad experience with it ever, and detail my best high and worst high with that particular drug


When finding out about a drug you're not familiar with, what information do you usually look for?

Sylvester- usually how long it lasts for and what are the worst case scenario and the best feelings to expect from it
Virgie - I always want to know what the worst thing that can happen is first, then duration, how they took it, what the effects are (I mostly like drugs that create euphoria, I don't like drugs that are "mind expanding" because they sound terrifying), proper dosage, source, and best way to ingest, and also any after-care if there are strong effects
